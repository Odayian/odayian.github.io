title: Building Blocs
---
A couple months ago I started Bloc.io's Part-time Web Developer course. Currently, I'm a few weeks out from finishing front-end development. Thankfully the curriculum hasn't been too hateful. 

To back things up a bit, I'd like to tell you a little bit about my background. I graduated from college in 2007 for computer systems. I have loved computers and engineering pretty much since they were available to consumers. Over the years I have coded as a hobby but was unable to take the extra time needed to make it a profession. However, I've taken that time to work with C++, C#, Java, Javascript, VB, VB.net, HTML, CSS, and a few other languages.

I've worked in computer related fields for several years. Everything from bench work, networking, to system administration and NMS. Eventually I hit a bump and have looked at several bootcamps that work with my busy schedule. After every review I've read and countless hours of research I finally decided on Bloc. 

Over the past few weeks I've realized how much has changed in syntax but thankfully the concepts have stayed the same. I'm kind of amazed at how many helper libraries are available along with online tutorials. These resources just weren't available at this volume, not even several years ago. Along the way I got to pick a mentor who has only been helpful and very responsive. Things have gone so well, that I even referred a friend and he started the Full-time Software Developer course. 

With Bloc so far, I have no complaints and can only look forward to what else will be taught and what projects will be completed.
