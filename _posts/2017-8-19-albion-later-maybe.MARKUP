title: ...Albion Later... Maybe
---
There is a game I recently started to play which reminded me a lot of EVE Online except on the ground instead of internet spaceships. It released several weeks ago under the name "Albion".  A brief explanation: Each is a game where thousands of people play with or against each other. Every item in the game is made by a real person. If your character has any items on them or using them and they die, a portion of the items are "dropped" for someone to pick up and use the others are destroyed. Lastly, these two games have it where you can take real money and purchase a token to sell for in-game currency or you can take in-game currency to purchase a token which will pay for another month of gaming. With having a number for real world monetary conversion, you have now given kills and losses monetary value.

The application I was looking to develop parsed a website hosted by the game developer and posted relevant information to a particular group of people in a popular chat program.

The website in question: [Albion Online Killboard](https://albiononline.com/en/killboard)

The website's json file: [Albion Online JSON](http://gameinfo.albiononline.com/api/gameinfo/events)

The application where I'd like to post filtered information: [Discord.gg](www.discord.gg)

Finally, a place to host said application: After a lot of research I went with [Heroku](www.heroku.com)

Guess I'm going to have some work ahead of me.
