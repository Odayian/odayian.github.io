## Explanation

Bloc-Jams is a web based music player designed with HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Angular.

## Problem

I was tired of using other web based services. It feels like every other song is an ad. UI/UX is horrible or un-responsive. This is where Bloc-Jams comes in. 

## Solution

Bloc-Jams offers a responsive interface regardless of device. It's also a place where you can listen to on-demand music without interruption. 

## Results

Bloc-Jams has been re-designed on the front-end to improve the consumer's experience. There has been positive feedback with the changes and will take any issues in to consideration for future updates. Back-end work is still being developed but do not see any upcoming issues. 

## Conclusion

Everything for the project is going to plan and should expect a full release once back-end development is complete.
